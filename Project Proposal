EE810 â€“ JAVA Final Project Proposal
Team Members: Yiran Li, Haoyang Li, Haoyu Zhang
Subject: Calendar Application
Project Description: We would like to develop a Calendar application based on C/S model using GUI programming.
Functional implements:
(1)	Changing the Year, Month to view the exact day;
(2)	Defining weekend days as holidays;
(3)	Loading the existing general vacation days and allowing users to set the individual important days;
(4)	Setting individual events on the calendar;
(5)	Reminding the approaching holidays or events both ahead of days that can be determined by users and on those days year by year;
(6)	Creating a reservation system with which we can avoid the time conflict. If we are going to set an event in a certain period and unfortunately there has been an important event lying there in that time, the reservation system can remind us the time conflict;
(7)	Saving out the state of the system to a file as JSON in such a way that you can load it back.
